## What is Lunalytics

Lunalytics is an open source monitoring tool built with Node.js & React. It's focused on a developer first experience with support for multiple users. You can currently monitor HTTP(s)/TCP connections, we'll be adding more in the future. I am also working on different monitoring systems other than pinging ðŸ‘€

## Why Lunlytics

There are a lot of other monitoring applications, both open source and paid services. But, all the open source applications I tested didn't meeting my requirements of supporting multiple users, having a nice developer experience, and lastly a clean and easy to use UI. For the paid applications, while they met the requirements they were either very expensive or had outdated UI. So I decided to spend a bit of time to create my own system that's focused on a developer first experience, along with support for multiple users.
