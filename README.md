## üìñ Backstory

There's a lot of monitoring applications out there and I personally love using uptime-kuma. But, one of the main issues with Uptime-kuma is the ability to share with my friends/colleagues. And for the services that do allow me to share with others, they either have an outdated UI from the 90s or are so expensive I can't justify paying for it.

So I've decided to create my own application that's focused on a developer first experience for teams and individual users.
